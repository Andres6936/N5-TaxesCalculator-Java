# Problem Description

The necessity exists for a person to know his/her amount owed on taxes before they
have to make the payment. In the same way, the organizations that collect these
taxes must have the information on the amounts people owe so it can carry on its
functions.

A taxes calculator must be able to calculate the amount owed in taxes for a given
vehicle, depending on the cars value and the discounts that apply to the person.

There are three possible types of discounts that can apply:

1. Immediate payment discount that consists of a percentage of the vehicle's value.

2. Public services discount that consists of a fixed flow discounted from the amount
owed on all public services vehicles.

3. Wire transfer discount that is also a percentage.

While making the taxes calculation one must take into account that: the wire transfer
percentage must be greater than the immediate pay percent discount.
The discounts are calculated in sequence using the last calculated value.
For example if there is a person that gets all the discounts, first you take away
the immediate payment discount, then the public services discount and finally the
wire transfer discount is calculated.

# Graphical User Interface

We need a GUI where you can view the information on the discounts and search for a
particular vehicle. In addition one must be able to select the relevant discounts
and view the total amount owed.
